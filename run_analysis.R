# Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now
# possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively
# inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement
# â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to
# improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are
# tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a
# particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In
# this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt,
# forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform
# barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information
# is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
# (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

## Data 
# 
# The training data for this project are available here: 
#   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
# The test data are available here: 
#   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
# The data for this project come from this source:
#   http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
# If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite
# them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for
# this kind of assignment.
